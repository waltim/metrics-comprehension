# Program Comprehension Metrics
This project aims to implement several metrics related to program comprehension.
In the current version, it computes the metric detailed in Buse and Weimer "A metric for software readability", Symposium on Software testing and analysis 2008 and the metric detailed in Posnett et al. "A Simpler Model of Software Readability", Mining Software Repositories, 2011.

# Build:
- Import project with a maven project;
- Change the full path to the directory where the code snippets are in the [PATH_MAIN_FOLDER] variable located in the IOEnum class of the utils package;
- Run the main class called Program in the applications package. Metric results will be printed on the terminal.
